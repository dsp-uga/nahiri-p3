"The  architecture  consists  of  a  contracting  path  to  capturecontext and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localiza-tion. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from veryfew  images  and  outperforms  the  prior  best  method  (a  sliding-windowconvolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neu-ronal  structures  in  electron  microscopic  stacks..."
